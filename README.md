# Solution for Version Matcher Problem
Tried to provide solution for below problem:

## Problem
The app consists of names of software packages, which are strings, and the latest available version number for that software
package. 

For the purposes of this program, assume that all version numbers are of the form X.Y or X.Y.Z where X, Y,
and Z are made up of only digits.

You have to design a data structure that will store this information (specifically, information about the latest version
number available for any software package). 

The primary use case for this data structure is that you'll be given two
strings, software_name, and version and you need to indicate whether this is the latest version for this software or
not.

## Acknowledgments
None for now :)
